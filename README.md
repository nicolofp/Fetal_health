Tree based model to predict the fetal health. The data comes from the following study:
*Ayres de Campos et al. (2000) SisPorto 2.0 A Program for Automated Analysis of Cardiotocograms. J Matern Fetal Med 5:311-318*, the link to the original paper is [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1520-6661(200009/10)9:5%3C311::AID-MFM12%3E3.0.CO;2-9).

We use tree based model to make predictions based on the dataset. The dataset and the information could be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification).
